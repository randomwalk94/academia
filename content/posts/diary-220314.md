I write things down to keep me awake.

1. Las Vegas ("[The Meadows](http://ponce.sdsu.edu/nelson_081008.html)") gets its water mostly from the [Colorado River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River), even though things have been becoming [drier recently](https://www.casino.org/blog/las-vegas-water-explained/). 
2. I was reading "[Principles: Life and Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles)" by [Ray Dalio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio), who founded [Bridgewater](https://www.bridgewater.com/) in 1975. 
3. The currency of the Netherlands once was "*[guilder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_guilder)*" (gulden, golden). It was replaced by the Euro when the country joined the EU in 2002.
4. The package manager of Arch Linux is called "*[Pacman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux#Pacman)*".
