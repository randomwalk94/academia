I write things down to keep me awake.

1. There are two types of data compression methods: **[lossless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression)** and **lossy**. Lossless means we can recover *perfectly* the original data from the compressed data. On the other hand, lossy just means *approximate* recovery.
2. **The Apple Lossless Audio Codec ([ALAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless_Audio_Codec))**, the lossless data compression method developed by Apple, was made *open-source* in 2011.
3. [**Go**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)) version 1.18 was released on this date adding support for *[fuzz testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing)*, the first major language to do so.
