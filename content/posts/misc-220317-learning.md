It is easy to get drowned in the sea of knowledge. I, many times, have tried to learn new stuff but then got demotivated pretty fast. The main reason was probably I didn't appreciate how those things would affect my life. However, I realized I was becoming *old* and it was not a good idea to waste time anymore. I will start my first significant job soon, and after that, the career path will become more difficult if I'm ill-prepared. Hence, I decided I need to change and really "force" myself (well, forcing is not a good method, but I can't find another word) to expand my expertises. 

Here are several things that I have always been eager to learn:

1. **Learn more coding**: [:(fab fa-brands fa-python):**Python**](https://www.python.org/) is top of the list. I also want to explore [**Julia**](https://julialang.org/) because of its use in high computing, [**:(fa-brands fa-golang):Go**](https://go.dev/) because the mascot is cute, [**:(fab fa-brands fa-js):JavaScript**](https://www.javascript.com/) (and some web programming) because I want to tweak my website sometimes, and [**:(fas fa-database):SQL**](https://go.dev/) because of data science. 
2. __Learn new languages__: I watched [**_Cirque du soleil_**](https://www.cirquedusoleil.com/) once in Vegas and was annoyed that I couldn't understand what they were speaking in *French* (you don't need to understand those parts to enjoy the show though). I decided that I needed to learn French (or at least being able to *read* and *hear*). There is also a good chance that my future colleagues will be French, so it is a smart idea to be able to communicate with them in their language. Japanese is something I want learn as well (took one course in college).
3. I found this e-book [**_Physically Based Rendering: From Theory To Implementation_**](https://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents) by chance and wanted to learn more about it at first sight. I always wonder how to simulate physics laws, how to represent real-world interactions in computers. Of course, my knowledge about this at the moment is `null`, so this is just going to be a side-project for me to kill some free time. I may to learn C++ in the process though.
4. Learn *machine learning*, *blockchain*, *data science*, etc., basically anything that will affect the future. Of course, the goal is not be an expert but to feel *literate*.

Arghhhh, so many things to learn, and time is limited... but it is going to fine.
